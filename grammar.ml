(**
    a grammarTree represents a grammar under the form of a tree. 
    The initial state is represented by Nill -> an empty tree
    We should always have (unless the grammar is empty) the root be a
    Var. Prod and Item should only appear in subtrees of a tree starting with a Var
    We have Var("Z", lg, rg) represents Z -> lg | rg 
            Var("Z", Prod(lg, rg), rg') represents Z -> lg.rg | rg' 
            Var("Z", Item(s), rg) represents Z -> s
    In cases were we have rules such as Z -> Xb and then X-> sZ
    we should have 
    Var("Z", 
        Prod(Var("X", Item(s), Var("Z", Nill, Nill)), Item(b)), 
        Nill
    )
    because Z is in the context of X so we allready know the rules for Z.
    this should also happen when we have Z -> XY and Y -> aX
    X is in the context of Y so we already know the rules for X, 
    there is no need to duplicate them here.
